# Removing information about yourself

## Deleting your own accounts

Despite the fact that the Internet remembers everything, deleting accounts remains one of the strongest means against basic intelligence on you.
It seems that this is a trivial topic, but there are several important nuances:

Before deleting:
1. Request the service **to upload your personal data** by GDPR. This will help in the next steps and give you an understanding of what
the service knows about you.
2. **Rename your account**, delete/change photos, wait a few days. This is necessary for indexer sites and search engines
we managed to update the information about your account, and subsequently you could not be found by its latest copy. Also, do not forget that
from now on you cannot leave any comments and messages publicly.
3. All old comments/tweets/messages **it is advisable to delete**. There are mechanisms in social networks and messengers that allow you to reach you even
after deletion: mentions (a link to your profile that looks like a name), a mark of authorship, reposts/retweets.
It's worth getting rid of all such leads.
4. Update the search results by asking them to reindex your **modified page** ([Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/ask-google-to-recrawl?hl=ru)) and wait for a while so that other systems that save information from social networks will also receive a new version of your account.

After that, the account can be deleted using the platform's built-in tools.

### Deletion request

Not in all services, deletion is possible by regular means. Or it is hidden so deep that it is impossible to find it.
Fortunately, there are auxiliary sites with information on how to retire.

- [JustDeleteMe](https://justdeleteme.xyz/) - an excellent directory for platforms, gives links and a description of the necessary actions,
shows the complexity of removal. The creators also have related sites [JustGetMyData](https://justgetmydata.com/) and
[JustWhatsTheData](https://justwhatsthedata.github.io/) to fulfill paragraph 1 above.

- [AccountKiller](https://www.accountkiller.com/en/all-sites) - removal instructions for a large number of sites, mainly Western.

Even if you couldn't find the removal instructions for the site you need, don't despair. There is always an opportunity to write
to support and request the deletion of your account according to GDPR.

## Deleting search results in search engines

Google offers a number of different forms through which you can request the removal and updating of content in search results.

- [Removing outdated content from search](http://search.google.com/search-console/remove-outdated-content) - well suited for pages that need to be reindexed (see above point 4 about deleting accounts).

- [Google Personal Data Deletion Request Form](https://reportcontent.google.com/forms/rtbf?hl=ru)

- [New request form for deletion of personal data](https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456)
